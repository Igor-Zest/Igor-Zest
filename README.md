About me: I have always dreamed and aspired to change the direction in which I work to an IT specialty.
This attracted the tester's specialization, which allows you to fully start the dive. After all, as soon as I found out about it, I realized that I had been engaged in testing all my life, albeit more generalized, 
I came to young campaigns and looked for different non-connections there and helped develop.
In the future, I want to develop in the direction of auto tests or switch to programming. 
I can work in multitasking mode and learn new things, at my last job I learned literally on the go and a lot, since the company was just developing and demanded everything from you at once.
A gamer with many years of experience, I like to read fiction, and arrange food tours.
I really love Japanese and Scandinavian cultures.

Experience: 

Yandex Practicum
Jun 2022 - Present · 5 mos

Student of the course “Testing Engineer”
● The web application was tested by Yandex Routes - during the testing process, I used test analysis skills and compiled test documentation using the means of CE, GZ, checklists and test cases. He also compiled a flowchart for the logic of calculating the cost of carsharing. With the help of Charles, he added data implemented in the Back to test them in a web application

● I tested the Yandex Metro mobile application - for this I used the Android SDK emulator of documentation and requirements in the form of a checklist compiled by me.

● With the help of POSTMAN, I tested new API functions of the service - Yandex Counter, for testing I used such methods as: GET * PUBLISH * PLACE * DELETE. Also changed the body of XML and JSON format requests

● Got logs from using console commands and put them in different files

● I also used the search and compiled a selection of the taxi application in the database via PostgreSQL, an example of a query: SELECT, REGISTER, WHEN, LIKE, OR, THEN, MORE, FROM WHERE, WHERE AND, ORDER, JOIN, etc.

● I discussed with my mentors the gray areas and “holes” in security that I found, one of them is the possibility of deleting an unauthorized user's trash while being authorized by another user. The review was also conducted repeatedly positively and without any mistakes.

● Also in the thesis, I wrote a number of mobile documentation and a website application “Yandex Scooter” when testing which all the previously listed skills were useful to me.
