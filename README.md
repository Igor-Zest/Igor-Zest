Head

About me: I have always dreamed and aspired to change the direction in which I work to an IT specialty, thereby attracting the specialization of a tester, which allows me to fully begin immersion.
In the future, I want to develop in the direction of autotests or switch to programming.
I can work in multitasking mode and learn something new, in my last job I learned literally on the go and a lot, since the campaign was just developing and required everything from you at once.
A gamer with many years of experience, I like to read fiction and arrange gastronomic tours.
I really love Japanese and Scandinavian cultures.
